In the following file:
1. knn_with_simple_code :
This program will help you to understand the basic working of a KNN Machine Learning model. The main objective of this file is to give you a clear visualization of how different KNN Models with different data inputs will work and how the Decision surface of each data set will look like, depending upon the KNN model and its efficiency to process the data.

2. kfold :
This program will help you understand and visualize hyperparameter tuning of an KNN algorithm i.e how to determing the optimal hyperparameter value(k value) of an KNN algorithm and visualizing prediction error associated with high k value.The following program use 10 folds to tune k value. 

3. Deep_Dive_Into_KNN: 
This is a document file where you will get all the important interview questions and also some links that will help you to enrich your knowledge in K-NN.
